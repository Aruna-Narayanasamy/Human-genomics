# Human-genomics
 - This project focuses on variant analysis of human chromosome 7 specifically targeting the CFTR gene associated with Cystic Fibrosis.
 - The workflow uses raw FASTQ files, aligns them to the hg38 chromosome 7 reference and performs variant calling using GATK HaplotypeCaller, and annotates variants related to CFTR.
 ## Tools:
  - FastQC
  - BWA-MEM
  - SAMTools
  - GATK
